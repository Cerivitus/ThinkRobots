--Challenge: An account_id can be tied to multiple customer_id creating duplicates when joining customers and bills
--Solution: created a new column num_cust from customers that will split amount based on number of customers tied to a specific account
--ex. if account A has total amount 100 and is tied to 2 customers Anna,Maria. 
--The adj_revenue will split the total evenly between the 2 customers and CSMs if they are tied to different CSMs

--Challenge: bills table is at a lower level of detail vs task 1 (bills table in task 1 aggregates total_charges YTD)
--Solution: I will aggregate bills data at an account_id level replicating the bills table from task 1 

--Challenge: need to identify csm's based on first letter of first name
--Solution: Case statement using the first letter of first_name and checking if between A-L then 'mark' otherwise 'janet'
